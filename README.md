# Karryn's Hot Desk

Karryn's Hot Desk is a gameplay mod for the **Receptionist battle** minigame in **Karryn's Prison**.

It adds 4 extra actions:
- `Charm Goblin (Pussy)`
- `Charm Goblin (Anal)`
- `Charm Goblin (Cunni)`
- `Strip Down`

## Current Version

- `1.4.1`

## What Players Get

- New receptionist-only goblin charm actions with direct sex-type choice.
- A quick `Strip Down` action for receptionist flow.
- Cleaner battle log text for charm outcomes.
- No permanent skill-list pollution outside Receptionist battles.

## How It Works (Simple)

- The mod creates custom skill data in memory when the game starts/loads.
- The 4 modded actions are available to **Karryn only** and only during the **Receptionist battle** mode.
- Outside Receptionist battles, these skills are not active.

   `Karryn's Prison/www/mods/`
2. Make sure the mod is enabled in your mod list.
3. Launch the game.

## In-Game Usage

3. Use `Strip Down` when you want to remove clothes and panties instantly.

## Notes and Compatibility

- Designed for the Receptionist minigame flow.
- This mod does not permanently teach these skills with normal global learning hooks.
- If another mod heavily changes Receptionist skill logic or battle-log behavior, load order may matter.
