# Karryn's Hot Desk

Karryn's Hot Desk is a mod for the **Receptionist** minigame.

## Features

- Adds `Charm Goblin (Pussy)`, `Charm Goblin (Anal)`, `Charm Goblin (Cunni)`, and `Strip Down`.
- You get three separate `Charm Goblin` skills that let you instantly choose and start Pussy, Anal, or Cunni with a goblin behind Karryn.
- `Strip Down` lets you remove skirt and panties in one action.
- The modded skills are only present during Receptionist battles, so your normal skill lists stay unchanged outside that mode.
- The mod adds new battle log messages for its custom skills.

## Skill Availability

- They should only be available in **Receptionist battles**.
- `Charm Goblin (...)` appears when a valid goblin is behind Karryn and she is in a state that can start that interaction.
- `Strip Down` appears when there is still clothing and/or panties left to remove.

## Skill Effects

- `Charm Goblin (Pussy)`: immediately starts the pussy interaction with a goblin behind Karryn.
- `Charm Goblin (Anal)`: immediately starts the anal interaction with a goblin behind Karryn.
- `Charm Goblin (Cunni)`: immediately starts the cunnilingus interaction with a goblin behind Karryn and can also act as a cleanup action for lower-body semen.
- `Strip Down`: instantly removes skirt and panties.

## Install

1. Put `KarrynsHotDesk.js` in `Karryn's Prison/www/mods/`.

## Compatibility Notes

- The mod should only affect the Receptionist minigame flow.
- Mods that heavily change Receptionist actions or battle log behavior can conflict.
- "Tested" only with the latest version of **Karryn's Prison**.
- Not sure whether all DLC is required (It should not be).
